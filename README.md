# hello-world
Start my Github life

Dear everyone,

I am Yiyuan Sun, a master student from Peking University. My major is photogrammetry and remote sensing, and my main researches focus on feature detection, matching and construction of computer vision. Also, I know some 3D reconstruction of photogrammetry, as well as I have been involved in polarization remote sensing.

In the future, maybe I will do a Phd and do some researches in global change and urban ecology, which belongs to the field of physical geography. 

I hope we can learn from each other and make progress together.

Best wishes,

-Yiyuan
